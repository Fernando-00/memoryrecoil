Press “Play” on the start menu screen to begin the game. 


Our game is a top-down third-person shooter game that also involves a maze component. 


Use the “A” and “D” keys to move left and right; Use the “W” and “S” to move up and down; use mouse/touchpad to rotate view of the character and left click to fire bullets. 
Press the “E” key to pick up an item and press “Q” to use the item. 


There are items on the floor, such as keys, coins, and a weapon that you can pick up. When an item is picked up using the “E” key, it will be added to the inventory; you can select what item to use by using the number keys to switch between items in your inventory. 


The blue items are coins. Once you kill an enemy, there will be coins dropped for you to collect, and you can use coins to buy power-ups from the shop. To use the power-up portion you have bought, select the item in your inventory using the number key and press “Q”. 


There are shops stationed around the map, indicated by a computer with a green tile to the right. There are various power-ups that you can buy using the coins you collected. To open the shop, press the “E” key. 


The map is split into five sections. There is one key in each section, and to move to the next section, find the key and use the key, by pressing “Q”,  to open the door to the next section.


Navigate through the maze, kill enemies coming your way, and find the exit to the maze to win.
